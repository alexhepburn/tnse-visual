# tnse-visual
t-SNE visualisation where you can view images corresponding to scatter points by hovering over them.

Uses Bokeh with a custom HTML hover command so that images are shown when you hover over a scatter point.

Features used in the t-SNE command are activations from a neural network that generated the shown images.
